# Lounge
Web Development Course: Final Assignment

The idea for this website stemmed from my love of Vinyl and Wine and how the two compliment each other so well. 
The final project was to showcase basic HTML, CSS and Bootstrap knowledge. The Lounge page is an introduction 
to the site and some simple write ups about owning vinyl and the love of music and wine. The Beats and Bottles page
showcases users pairings of music and wine, with included links to buy both suggestions. The Sessions page includes 
the form to contribute to the Beats and Bottles page.
